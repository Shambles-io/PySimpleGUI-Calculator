This is a fairly basic calculator GUI application made with Python (version 3.9.7).

When the app opens, the user(s) may begin by right-clicking anywhere within the window. This creates a pop-up menu of several themes for the user to choose from. When a theme is selected, the window will close, then relaunch with the new selected theme. If 'random' is selected, the app will relaunch a randomly-selected theme.

Note: The user MUST clear the screen (Pressing the 'Clear' button) between uses.

Enjoy!
